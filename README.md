TASK 3: QUIZ GAME APPLICATION

🎉 Just built my very own Quiz Game Web App during my SkillCraft Technology internship – and I’m super pumped to share it! 🎉

Imagine testing your web dev knowledge while having fun — yep, that’s exactly what this app does! Built with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript, it features:

🔥 Cool animations that make clicking feel awesome
✨ Instant feedback with score tracking to keep you hooked
🎨 A sleek, colorful UI that’s easy on the eyes
❓ Multiple-choice questions designed to challenge and teach

This project wasn’t just about coding — it was about creating an experience! It pushed me to think about user interaction, clean design, and dynamic functionality.

🙌 Massive shoutout to SkillCraft Technology for giving me this hands-on challenge — nothing beats learning by doing!
